# Task Management

All task-related work must follow the organization's task management standard defined in:

@docs/task-management.md

This is the canonical reference for task lifecycle, naming conventions, storage structure, approval rules, and quality gates. Agent commands (`/task-init`, `/task-do`) implement this standard.
